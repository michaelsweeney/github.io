    <h2>In the meantime</h2>

    <p>
      This page is really a place for me to explore ideas and show off some
      things I've been working on. Sometimes it's a little daunting going to
      people's GitHub pages and perusing around. So maybe this is an index /
      table-of-conetents / readme for all the other readmes.

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h2>eqparse</h2>
    <p>eqparse is a library I've been working on for a while now.</p>

    <h2>epparse</h2>
    <p>same as eqparse but for energyplus</p>
    <h2>eqinp</h2>
    <p>these python names are now getting ridiculous.</p>
